# How

## How to pip install a library.

To install a Python library from the Python Package index we use `pip` by typing
the following at the command line.

````{tip}
```
$ python -m pip install <library>
```
````

For example to install `ciw` a library used to study queuing systems:

```
$ python -m pip install ciw
```

```{attention}
Well documented libraries will always have installation installation. It is
recommended to read those before installing a library.
